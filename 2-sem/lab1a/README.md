* Code that was taken for refactoring - https://github.com/Megarekrut65/OP2019-2020/tree/master/Lab1

Changes for refactoring:
* split menus, interactive, demo and other modes into separate files.
* create three classes for three modes: storage in memory, text file and binary file. Also split them into separate files. Create a parent class with methods that will be common to the previous three classes.
* reduce the amount of duplication of code in the automatic mode "benchmark".
* add graphical interface.
